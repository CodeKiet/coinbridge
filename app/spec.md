## Overview

**CoinFish** (<http://coin.fish>) is a "gateway" service that converts Bitcoin deposits to either Bitcoin IOUs, or to the native currencies of the Ripple and/or Stellar financial networks.

**This is a draft specification.**  Multiple revisions of the wording and content are expected before it is finalized.  The user interfaces and screen layouts are shown here for illustration.  The actual look and feel will be created iteratively, driven by input from users and/or designers.

This spec covers the user's experience when they interact with **CoinFish**.  Technical implementation details are not discussed here.

## Use Cases

1. The principal use case for **CoinFish** is new entrants to the Stellar network who want to convert an existing cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, to *Stellars* (STR), the Stellar network's internal currency.

2. The equivalent use case of conversions to and from Ripple's internal currency, *Ripples* (XRP), exists as well.  This is likely to be secondary, as there are many competing, established gateways on the Ripple network.

## What We're Not Doing

**CoinFish** does *not* include, or intend to include, support for deposits from or withdrawls to fiat currencies, such as U.S. dollars.  This exclusion is made primarily for legal/regulatory reasons.
